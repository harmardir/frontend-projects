    <h1>My Resource Sheet</h2>
    
    <p>This page consists of examples of <strong>HTML elements</strong>. Elements often have beginning and ending tags, with data in between.</p>
    
    <p>The body tag is where all of the webpage content goes. All of the paragraphs, headings, images, links, footers, tables and forms go inside of the body tab. On this page the body tag contains text to show you samples of some of the elements. In fact, this paragraph and the one above are inside paragraph elements.</p>
    
    <h1>This is an h1 heading.</h1>
    <p>Headings are always bold, and vary in size depending on which one you select. You might note the the heading at the top that says "My Resource Sheet" is an h1 heading. The heading for the "List Examples" below is also an h1 heading.
    </p>
    
    <h2>This is an h2 heading.</h2>
    <p>The h2 heading is slightly smaller than the h1 heading. However, it is still bold. Also notice that there are automatically blank lines before and after each heading. Otherwise, you would see the use of break tags (br) between each of the headings. By the way the headings below for "Unordered List Example", "Ordered List Example", and "Definition List Example" are all h2 headings.
    </p>
    
    <h3>This is an h3 heading.</h3>
    <p> This text is inside of an h3 heading, which is slightly smaller than the h2 heading. By the way, there are three additional levels of headings - h4, h5, and h6. Each level decreases in size, with the h6 heading being the smallest. However, they all display bold text, and they all include a blank line before and after the heading.
